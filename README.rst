=============

This is a Plone buildout for UPIQ projects.  It aims to include Python 2.7
and an application stack build for Plone including:

* varnish + haproxy front end
* PosgreSQL and Memcached for use by RelStorage back-end.
* UPIQ and third-party add-ons, customizations

Building Python
---------------

* Mac: as of OS X 10.11 (El Capitan), OpenSSL libraries are not included
  in the core Apple distribution of the OS.
  As such, use of homebrew openssl package is recommended, via:

  - `$ brew install openssl`

  - Set LDFLAGS and CFLAGS in your profile or prior to executing
    the Python buildout:

    .. code-block:: bash

        export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib
        export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
