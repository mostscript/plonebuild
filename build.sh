#   build.sh: wrap buildouts contained for:
#       
#       1. Python
#           (based on collective.buildout.python)
#       
#       2. Plone 4.3 Application deployment build with:
#           * Three ZServer instances
#           * A debug instance
#           * RelStorage with PostgreSQL backend
#           * memcached, libmemcached, pylibmc for RelStorage
#           * Varnish
#           * HAProxy
#           * Psycopg2, lxml, and other Python libraries
#           * Test runners and coverage
#           * supervisor to control all your long-running processes
#
#       Assumption: this buildout takes care of everything but the front-end
#                   web server for you; proxy from nginx|apache provided
#                   by your operating system to the Varnish included here.
#
#                   nginx -> varnish -> haproxy ==> zope(s)
#
#                   * Can and should be extended with a site.cfg; see 
#                     app/src/build/site.cfg.example
#
#                   * This buildout is run and tested on 64bit
#                     Linux and Mac OS X.
